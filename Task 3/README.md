# Multiple Disease Prediction Webapp

> Abstract : This project involves predicting multiple diseases using a machine learning (ML) model and deploying the system as an interactive web application via Streamlit. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset with various health indicators, we trained and evaluated several ML algorithms to select the most accurate model. The Streamlit-based app offers a user-friendly interface where users input medical data to receive real-time disease predictions and health insights. This system aims to enhance early diagnosis and decision-making in healthcare, showcasing the potential of ML and web technologies in improving health management.
